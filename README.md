# scaling octo meme
This is my own version of Kinoite based on the Ublue-OS version.
I wanted quite a vanilla experience in terms of KDE/Plasma still with the added bells and whistles of ublue-os.

Name of this repo (scaling octo meme) is the default random name by the ublue-os template script. Check [here](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template) for the template repo.
